    <p>Excision shows are like no other. A virtual apocalypse of twisting and morphing sounds turn massive crowds into a frenzy. Earth-shattering walls of bass relentlessly smash upon the bodies of headbanging fans around the world.

      Hailing from Kelowna, British Columbia, Excision’s diverse skills as a DJ and producer constantly test the limits of electronic music with vastly different sets that encompass a full range of genres. The things you see and hear during the precious time you are engaged by Excision’s sounds will eclipse your mind for a lifetime.
      
      With 10+ years of constant touring under his belt, two major music festivals to call his own in Bass Canyon (August – Washington) and Lost Lands (September – Ohio), multiple chart-topping hits and millions of screaming fans around the world, Excision has proven himself as the true champion of Bass Music.
      
      Excision’s fourth full-length studio album Apex (2018) adds another groundbreaking achievement to his already staggering collection of original music, following up from Virus (2016), Codename X (2015) and X Rated (2011), plus countless singles, collabs, mixes, and EPs over the last decade.
